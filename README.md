# ACO Algorithms for the TSP

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a heuristic algorithm which has been proven a successful technique and applied to a number of combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most important combinatorial problems. ACO is taken as one of the high performance computing methods for TSP.

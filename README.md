# ACO Algorithm for the TSP

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a heuristic algorithm which has been proven a 
successful technique and applied to a number of combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. 
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is one of the most important combinatorial problems. 
ACO is taken as one of the high performance computing methods for TSP.

The idea was published in the early 90s for the first time. The
base of ACO is to simulate the real behaviour of
ants in nature. The functioning of an ant colony
provides indirect communication with the help
pheromones, which ants excrete. Pheromones are
chemical substances which attract other ants
searching for food. The attractiveness of a given
path depends on the quantity of pheromones that
the ant feels. Pheromones excretion is governed by
some rules and has not always the same intensity.
The quantity of pheromones depends on the
attractiveness of the route. The use of more
attractive route ensures that the ant exudes more
pheromones on its way back and so that path is
more also attractive for other ants. The important
characteristic of pheromones is evaporation. This
process depends on the time. When the way is no
longer used, pheromones are more evaporated and
the ants begin to use other paths.
